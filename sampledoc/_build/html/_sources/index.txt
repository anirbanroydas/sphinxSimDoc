==============

    :alt: SphinxSimDoc

A collection of simple docs build from scratch using sampledocs from `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html>`_ and also by using `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html>`_.

Introduction
============

This is a tutorial introduction to quickly get you up and running with your own sphinx documentation system. We'll cover installing sphinx, customizing the look and feel and a little bit more general stuffs.

If you follow along the tutrial, you'll start with nothing and end up with this -- documentation site itself, thus the method 2 mentioned in the README, and hence the recursive nature.

It's the bootstrapping documenation tutorial that writes itself. Voila!
