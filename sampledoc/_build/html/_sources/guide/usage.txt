This guide will give you information about how to use the documentation to create the same documenation

``Step 1``

Go to this `documenation <http://matplotlib.org/sampledoc>`_  page and follow the tutorials. 

``Step 2``

Create your own repository just like this sphinxSimDoc repo was created.


``Step 3``

Use the documentation tutorial to make a new repo having all the rst files included in this repo. 

``Step 4``

Make the docs and you will be able to have your own sampledoc ready


Alternatively
-------------

Go straight to the index page of this doc and you can follow the instructions from there itself without having to go to the above documentation page. 

This page is created in using the earlier mentioned tutorial page. Hence the recursive nature.
