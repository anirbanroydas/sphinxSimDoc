x is far and away the most popular Python documentation tool. Use it. It converts reStructuredText markup language into a range of output formats including HTML, LaTeX (for printable PDF versions), manual pages, and plain text.


reStructuredText
----------------

Most Python documentation is written with `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_. Itâ€™s like `Markdown <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown>`_ with all the optional extensions built in.

The `reStructuredText Primer <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html>`_ and the `reStructuredText Quick Reference <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`_ should help you familiarize yourself with its syntax.
